comment: Inoculation can refer to introduction of live and not attenuated organism to induce immunity (as opposed to vaccine which introduces killed or attenuated organism). Problem is, can also refer to introduction of organism into cell culture and other things that aren't immunization processes. So, do we take it out, or make it a sibling of immunization and risk having multiple inheritance, or define a narrower term "inoculation of host" to rule out the cell culture and other scenarios in which immunity does not result.
